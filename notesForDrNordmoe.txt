on page 8 of 30, I want to express the adaptive nature of web-scraping. They are hard to fend off because they have many ways to request information from the websites.

on page 13 of 30, for the three ways of collecting data, the secondary resource doesn't work because they cannot always find helpful databases... If there are always available and helpful databases for every customer, they don't need the trouble of collecting data from the web, right?
